# Documentation of the Code

This is an Ansible playbook with two tasks. Ansible is a popular automation tool that can perform various system tasks such as restarting services, installing packages, and so on. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the playbook:

## Task 1: Restart JBoss
```yaml
- name: restart jboss
  service:
    name: jboss
    state: restarted
```
This task is named "restart jboss". The purpose of this task is to restart the JBoss service on the target hosts. 

The `service` module is being used here. This module manages the state of services in a system. 

The `name` under the `service` module is the name of the service that the task will operate on. Here, it is "jboss".

The `state` is the desired state for the service. In this task, the `state` is "restarted", which means if the service is running, it will be stopped and then started again. If the service is not running, it will be started.

## Task 2: Restart IPTables
```yaml
- name: restart iptables
  service:
    name: iptables
    state: restarted
```
This task is similar to the first one, but it operates on a different service, the iptables.

The `name` under the `service` module here is "iptables", which is the name of the service that the task will operate on.

Like the first task, the `state` is also "restarted", which means the iptables service will be stopped and then started again if it's already running, or it will be started if it's not running.

To execute these tasks, you would typically run the playbook using the Ansible command line tool, specifying the target hosts.
