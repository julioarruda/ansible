# Code Documentation

This code is a configuration script for the IPTables firewall, which is used to manage network communication to and from a system. It's written in Ansible which is an open-source automation tool. The `{{ ansible_managed }}` at the top is a variable that Ansible replaces with a comment stating the file is managed by Ansible.

The code begins by setting the default policies for the INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT chains to ACCEPT. This means any traffic that doesn't match a rule is allowed.

```markdown
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [4:512]
```

The next three rules accept traffic based on its state. The first rule allows established and related incoming traffic. The second rule allows ICMP traffic, which includes ping requests and responses. The third rule allows all traffic on the loopback interface.

```markdown
-A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
```

The next three rules allow new incoming TCP connections on ports 22, `{{ http_port }}`, and `{{ https_port }}`. Port 22 is generally used for SSH, while `{{ http_port }}` and `{{ https_port }}` are placeholders for the HTTP and HTTPS ports, respectively.

```markdown
-A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport {{ http_port }} -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport {{ https_port }} -j ACCEPT
```

Any incoming traffic that doesn't match the above rules is rejected with an ICMP host prohibited message.

```markdown
-A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
```

The same rule is applied to forwarded traffic.

```markdown
-A FORWARD -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
```

The `COMMIT` line applies the changes.

```markdown
COMMIT
```

In summary, this script sets up a basic firewall that accepts established and related incoming traffic, along with ICMP and loopback traffic. It also allows new connections on specific ports but rejects all other incoming and forwarded traffic.
