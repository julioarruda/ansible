# Documentation

The provided code is a series of Ansible tasks for deploying WAR (Web Application Archive) files to a JBoss server.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Copy `jboss-helloworld.war` to host

This task uses Ansible's `copy` module to copy the `jboss-helloworld.war` file from the local machine to the target host's `/tmp` directory.

```yaml
- name: Copy application WAR file to host
  copy:
    src: jboss-helloworld.war
    dest: /tmp
```

### 2. Deploy HelloWorld to JBoss

This task uses Ansible's `jboss` module to deploy the `jboss-helloworld.war` file to a JBoss server. The `deploy_path` specifies the directory where the WAR file will be deployed. The `src` parameter is the location of the WAR file in the target host. The `state` parameter with the value of `present` means that the WAR file should be deployed.

```yaml
- name: Deploy HelloWorld to JBoss
  jboss:
    deploy_path: /usr/share/jboss-as/standalone/deployments/
    src: /tmp/jboss-helloworld.war
    deployment: helloworld.war
    state: present
```

### 3. Copy `ticket-monster.war` to host

This task is identical to the first one, but it copies the `ticket-monster.war` file instead.

```yaml
- name: Copy application WAR file to host
  copy:
    src: ticket-monster.war
    dest: /tmp
```

### 4. Deploy Ticket Monster to JBoss

This task is identical to the second one, but it deploys the `ticket-monster.war` file instead.

```yaml
- name: Deploy Ticket Monster to JBoss
  jboss:
    deploy_path: /usr/share/jboss-as/standalone/deployments/
    src: /tmp/ticket-monster.war
    deployment: ticket-monster.war
    state: present
```

These tasks are typically used in a playbook to automate the deployment of applications to a JBoss server.
