# Documentation for Ansible Playbook

The provided source code is a simple Ansible playbook that deploys a standalone JBoss server. 

## Overview

Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code. In this playbook, we are using Ansible to deploy a JBoss server.

JBoss is an open-source application server program that provides a runtime environment for Java-based applications. A standalone JBoss server means that it runs in its own process, separate from your application process.

## Code Walkthrough

```yaml
# This playbook deploys a simple standalone JBoss server.

- hosts: all

  roles:
    - jboss-standalone
```

Let's break down the code:

1. `# This playbook deploys a simple standalone JBoss server.`: This line is a comment describing what the playbook does.

2. `- hosts: all`: This line specifies that the playbook should be run on all hosts that are specified in Ansible's inventory. The inventory is a list of nodes or hosts (with their IP addresses or hostnames) on which tasks can be run. You can specify a specific host, a group of hosts, or `all` to include every host.

3. `roles:`: This keyword is used to call certain pre-defined tasks, which are organized into roles. 

4. `- jboss-standalone`: This is the role that will be assigned to all hosts. This role should have been previously defined, and it should contain all the tasks needed to deploy a standalone JBoss server. 

Please note that the actual tasks that will be executed on the hosts are defined within the `jboss-standalone` role, and are not shown in this playbook. This role should be located in a directory called `roles/` at the same level as your playbook. Inside the `jboss-standalone` directory, you will typically find other directories like `tasks/`, `handlers/`, `files/`, and `templates/`, which contain the actual tasks and files needed to deploy the JBoss server.

## Usage

To run this playbook, you would use the `ansible-playbook` command followed by the playbook file name, as shown below:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

This command will run the playbook `playbook.yml`, and deploy a standalone JBoss server on all hosts specified in your Ansible inventory.
